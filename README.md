# parupaint chrome client
this is the chrome client interface to parupaint-web.

development is primarily done in Google Chrome Unstable (dev) because of extended use of css3 things. feel free to try it on others and report bugs, but my main focus is to first get it all together.

## to install

- clone it
- go to chrome://extensions in your browser
- enable developer mode
- Load unpacked extension...
- select the folder and load it
